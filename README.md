# SHOWTIME - a Squeezebox Touch Clock Project

This is a super niche hobby project for enthusiasts interested in displaying the current time and date on their Squeezebox Touch, using images generated by containers running on a Synology NAS.

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts that generate images for displaying the current time, date, and a Swiss-style clock face. These images are designed to be shown on a Squeezebox Touch device, providing a customized clock display.

### Components

1. `generate-swiss-clock.py`: Creates a high-quality image of a Swiss-style clock face with the current time.
2. `generate-date-image.py`: Produces an image with the current date and time in text format.

## Features

- Swiss-style clock face with hour and minute hands
- Text-based date and time display
- High-resolution images optimized for Squeezebox Touch display
- Customizable background colors and font styles

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork) library
- A Synology NAS for running the scripts in containers
- Squeezebox Touch device for display

## Usage

1. Generate the showtime container and upload to Container manager 
2. Configure your Synology NAS to run the showtime container at regular intervals (e.g., every minute)
3. Set up the NAS web server. Make sure the generated images are saved to a webserver directory.
4. Set up your Squeezebox Touch to fetch the generated images.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the generated images:

- Clock face colors and dimensions in `generate-swiss-clock.py`
- Date and time font, colors, and layout in `generate-date-image.py`

## Note

This project is designed for a very specific use case and requires some technical knowledge to set up and maintain. It's perfect for Squeezebox Touch owners who want a unique and personalized clock display.

# SHOWTIME - a Squeezebox Touch Clock Project

This is a hobby project for owners of Squeezebox Touch. It generates images displaying the current time and date on their Squeezebox Touch, using containers running on a Synology NAS. These images can be run in the standard Squeezebox Touch screen saver, possibly alternated with weather forecasts, news etc generated by other services.

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts that generate two different images: one showing date and time as text, the other as a clock face. 

### Components

1. `generate-swiss-clock.py`: Creates a high-quality image of a Swiss railway style clock face displaying the current time.
2. `generate-date-image.py`: Produces an image with the current date and time in text format.

## Features

- Clock face with hour and minute hands
- Text-based date and time display
- Night mode
- Customizable background color and font styles 

## Requirements

- A Synology NAS running DSM 7.x and Container Manager
- Squeezebox Touch device for display

## Usage

1. Generate the showtime container and upload it to Container manager on the Synology box
2. Set up the NAS web server.
3. Configure your Synology NAS to run the showtime container. Map /app/output for container to a web server directory, for example (showtime) 
4. Set up your Squeezebox Touch to fetch the generated images from the server (Synology local IP/showtime/swiss-clock.png and date_time.png)

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the generated images:

- Clock face colors and dimensions in `generate-swiss-clock.py`
- Date and time font, colors, and layout in `generate-date-image.py`

## Note

This project is designed for a very specific use case and requires some technical knowledge to set up and maintain. It's perfect for Squeezebox Touch owners who want a unique and personalized clock display. I developed this on a Macbook for a Synology DS 918+. I have not tested elsewhere.
